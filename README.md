# Analysis of Car Listings on eBay Using Pandas
This is a guided project from DataQuest.io (online platform to learn Data Analysis and Data Science).

The learning goal of the project is to practice data cleaning and data exploration using pandas.

Our dataset contains used car listings from German section of eBay website. Weâ€™ll explore the data, clean it up, and look for patterns using aggregation.

The data and code in Part I was part of the course. Part II is my original work.
